Sobra akong grateful kasi ever since, andiyan ka lagi so patient, so understanding, and lagi mo akong tinutulungan lalo na sa Tagalog ko. Hindi ko ma-explain how much I appreciate you. Sana today and every day, maramdaman mo how special and loved you are. You deserve all the good things, sobra.

I hope this year brings you so much peace and happiness, yung tipong kahit simple things, you’ll always find comfort in them. Sana rin you’ll always have the strength to keep going kahit gaano pa kahirap minsan. I’ll always cheer for you in every little and big win. Happiest birthday ulit, my lowkey baby may this day remind you na you’re worth celebrating every single time.”</p>

      <p class="form-message">“To Dietr,

Happiest birthday, Wyldest Dietr! Our friendship may have been unexpected, but I’m truly grateful about it. I’m so happy that we met and became close friends. At first, I was a bit shy to act friendly toward you since I was still observing your personality. But as time went by, I realized how easygoing and funny you are, and it made me comfortable to be closer to you. I hope your sweet and cheerful personality never changes, because it’s one of the things I admire most about you. I really enjoy hearing your stories, chikas, and rants. I might not be the best when it comes down to giving advice or even participating, but I just want you to know that it means a lot to me that you trust me enough to tell me all of those things. Please know that I value you and our friendship so much. I also hope to be there for your future birthdays. Thank you for being such a wonderful friend to me! May this special day bring you all the happiness you deserve!

      <p class="form-message">“Hi Dietq! We’ve been bffs na for so long (for me it’s long na and for me, bff na tayo kahit di bff tingin mo to me!) I’m so happy to be friends with you, kahit binabardagulan mo lang me dati. You’ll always be the Mojojo to us Powerpuff Girls, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.

On your special day, I just wish you endless happiness, good health, and success in everything you do. May you always find reasons to laugh, people who genuinely support you, and opportunities that bring you closer to your dreams. Stay the funny, strong, and one-of-a-kind friend that you are. 

Happiest birthday, Dietq! Wag mo na ako maging crush, bawal magkacrush sa amo. Woof ka nga.”</p>

      <h2>From: Cediel</h2>
      <p class="form-message">“Hey, happy birthday. I just want to say how I perceive you; it's that—I see you as someone who never backs down to fight what's right. You always stand to your ground and never wavers to something or someone. I think you're a strong person. And if you think that you're otherwise, then be strong. : ] 

Ayon, thank you sa buhay mo. Nakakilala ako ng taong katulad mo na binabatikos ang mali, kinokompronta ang mga bagay na dapat ina-address ng masa at ng media. You disturbed those who are in comfort and at some point, you comfort those who are disturbed, including me, including you— that's amazing, in its own way. I wish you a happy life after all the sacrifices and hardship you endure in your existence. You deserve all the good things in life, that even you might probably say na hindi ka naman mabuting tao. Happy birthday.”</p>
